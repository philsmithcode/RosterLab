If the opposition player suffers a Casualty as a result of a failed Dodge, Leap or Jump away from a square in this player's Tackle Zone, then this player will count as having caused that Casualty and will receive Star Player Points as appropriate.<br/>

                    When this player is activated, the only action they can declare is a Ball & Chain Special Action; there is no limit to the number of players that can declare this Special Action each Turn.<br/>
When a player performs a Ball & Chain Special Action, position the Throw-in Template over this player so it faces one of the two End Zones or either Sideline. Then roll a D6 and move this player into the square as indicated by the Throw-in Template.<br/>
A player that moves in this manner does not have to make an Agility Test to Dodge away from another player's Tackle Zone; they will automatically pass. Opposition players cannot use the Shadowing or Tentacles Skills against a player performing a Ball & Chain Action.
<ul><li>If this move takes this player off the pitch, they will risk Injury by the Crowd.</li>
<li>If this move takes this player into a square containing a Standing player (from either team) they will automatically perform a Block Action against that player; this Block Action will ignore the Foul Appearance Skill. If this is a team-mate, then this player's Coach will choose which result to apply after the Block Dice have been rolled.<l/i>
<li>If this move takes this player into a square containing a Prone or Stunned player, that player is Pushed Back and an Armour Roll is made against them.</li>
<li>If this move takes this player into a square containing the ball, it will immediately Bounce. This will not cause a Turnover.</li></ul>
A player performing a Ball & Chain Special Action can move a number of squares up to their MA. They may Rush as normal, though if they roll a 1, they will move into the square as normal first, including performing any Block Actions, Pushing Back any players or causing the ball to Bounce, before Falling Over in the square they have moved into.<br/>
If this player is Knocked Down, Falls Over or Placed Prone for any reason, immediately make an Injury Roll for them treating any result of Stunned as Knocked-out instead. A player with this Trait cannot have any of the following Skills: Diving Tackle, Eye Gouge, Frenzy, Grab, Hit & Run, Leap, Multiple Block, On the Ball, Shadowing, Steady Footing.                </div>

A Kick Team-mate Special Action works exactly the same as a Throw Team-mate Action, with the following exceptions:<br/>

However, if a Kick Team-mate Special Action results in a Fumbled Throw, immediately make an Injury Roll for the team-mate being kicked, treating any result of Stunned as Knocked Out. If the kicked player was holding the ball, it will Bounce from the square they were in.
</br>Any Skills or Traits that come into play when a player performs a Throw Team-mate Action will also apply to a Kick Team-mate Special Action. This player will also gain Star Player Points in the same manner as a Throw Team-mate Action.                </div>

Should this player Fall Over during this move, then their move immediately ends and the Pass Action resumes. If multiple players have this Skill, then they may all use it during the same Pass Action, though they must do so one at a time, and if one of them Falls Over before the others have had the chance to move, then they may not do so.<br/>
Additionally, during the Start of Drive Sequence, after the Kick Deviates but before the Kick-off Event is rolled, a single Open player on the receiving team with this Skill may move up to 3 squares, following all the usual rules for a Move Action, with the exception that they cannot Rush. A player may not use this Skill if a Touchback is caused and may not move into the opposition half. Should this player Fall Over during this move, then their move immediately ends and the Kick-off Event is rolled.                </div>

If after their Move Action this player is in possession of the ball, they can Punt it downfield.

If the ball lands in a square containing a player, then they must attempt to Catch the ball, otherwise it will Bounce.<br/>
